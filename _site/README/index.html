<h1>11ty Test Drive</h1>
<p>This repo is a space for experimenting with the Eleventy SSG as an alternative to Jekyll. I've brought over a few approaches that have worked well for me with Jekyll that are a bit outside of what I've seen for common 11ty workflows so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gulp, which offers a bit more flexibility for tasks and sequences, and allows me to run my own flavor of Browsersync (in this case, with PHP support for the occasinal form).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gulp-SASS, in this case with Sourcemaps built in. There is a SASS plugin for 11ty, but this option seems a bit cleaner and more flexible—and doesn't tie me to one developer's project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Browsersync—part of 11ty, or course—but I wanted a bit more control over how it runs than I was easily able to figure out with what came as part of 11ty. In addition to supporting PHP, I also wanted this site to run on a different port (3030). This, I suspect, will help avoid conflicts with serviceworkers I have running on other sites I develop and test locally (on :3000).</p>
</li>
</ul>
